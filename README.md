# Deployment via CI/CD

The software is automatically deployed as a Docker
container via GitHub Actions on the main branch, contingent upon the
successful completion of automated tests. The application is
self-hosted on an on-premises server located in Par√°, Brazil, and is
accessible through the domain https://cancer.manoel.dev, utilizing
Cloudflare Tunnels for internet exposure.

# Manual deployment

If you have the proper credentials exported as environment variables:

- `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID`
- `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`

You can deploy the application with:

```
make deploy
```
